    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;
    color: white;"> 
   In <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: yellow;">computer graphics</span>, pixelation (or pixellation in (<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: yellow;">British English</span>) is caused by displaying a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: yellow;">bitmap</span> or a section of a bitmap at such a large size that individual <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: yellow;">pixels</span>, small single-colored square display elements that comprise the bitmap, are visible. Such an image is said to be <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: yellow;">pixelated</span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">pixellated</span> in the UK).
   <br><br>
   Early graphical applications such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">video games</span> ran at very low <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">resolutions</span>
    with a small number of colors, resulting in easily visible pixels. 
   The resulting sharp edges gave curved objects and diagonal lines an unnatural appearance. 
   However, when the number of available colors increased to 256, it was possible to gainfully employ <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">anti-aliasing</span> to smooth the appearance of low-resolution objects, 
   not eliminating pixelation but making it less jarring to the eye. Higher resolutions would soon make this type of pixelation all but invisible on the screen, 
   but pixelation is still visible if a low-resolution image is printed on paper.
   <br><br>
   In the realm of real-time <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">3D computer graphics</span>, pixelation can be a problem. Here, bitmaps are applied to polygons as <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">textures</span>.
   As a camera approaches a textured polygon, simplistic <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">nearest neighbor texture filtering</span> would simply zoom in on the bitmap, creating drastic pixelation. 
   The most common solution is a technique called pixel interpolation that smoothly blends or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interpolates</span> the color of one pixel into the color of the next adjacent pixel 
   at high levels of zoom. This creates a more organic, but also much blurrier image. There are a number of ways of doing this; see <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">texture filtering</span> for details.
   <br><br>
   Pixelation is a problem unique to bitmaps. Alternatives such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">vector graphics</span> or purely geometric polygon models can scale to any level of detail. 
   This is one reason vector graphics are popular for printing, most modern computer monitors have a resolution of about 100 dots per inch, and at 300 dots per inch 
   printed documents have about nine times as many pixels per unit of area as a screen. Another solution sometimes used is <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">procedural textures</span>, textures such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">fractals</span>
   that can be generated on-the-fly at arbitrary levels of detail.

    color: white;"> Deliberate Pixelation</h1>

<h2 style="font-size: 20px;
    color: white;"> 
In some cases, the resolution of an image or a portion of an image is lowered to introduce pixelation deliberately. This effect is commonly used on television news shows 
to obscure a person's face or to censor <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">nudity</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">vulgar gestures</span>, and is also used for artistic effect. This effect is called <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">pixelization</span>. 
Making pixels easily visible is also a main feature in <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: yellow;">pixel art</span> which is where the graphics are made in low resolutions for effect.

Depixelization removes pixelization from images, attempting to reconstruct the appearance of the original (unpixelated) image.
